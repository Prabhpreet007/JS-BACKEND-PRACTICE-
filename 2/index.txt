common js vs ecmascript modules(ESM):

commonjs is widely used because it was introduced very early
ESM is less used beacuse it is relatively new

but ESM is better than commonjs
ESM loads the modules asynchronously
common js loads the modules synchronously

which makes ESM more fast
ESM is used in frontend library also...



The code which is async is nature
it doesnt blocks the main thread is called as non blocking code
